<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="color:#0000FF;">HIS HOLINESS "SREE MAHAN KANNADI SWAMIAR" who is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient and of immortal memory entered Jeeva Samadhi by leaving HIS mortal body in HIS original form i.e. LIGHT on Monday 23 rd March 1903 and this fortunate event was witnessed by HIS disciple Late Sri M.R.Ry.M.Doorvasa Mudaliar and his family members along with other devotees. The devotion and gratitue of HIS disciple and devotees found concrete expression, in the errection of the shrine in the garden of late Sri M.R.Rly.Arcot Rangaswamy Mudaliar (now known as Paigah colony, Behind Anand theatre, Sardar Patel Road, Secunderabad) with the permission of the owner late Nawab Sir Asmanjah Bahadur, K.C.S.I. Prime Minster of Hyderabad State and the exact spot of the Samadhi was seelcted by HIS HOLINESS.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
The credit and privilege for the errection of the Shrine in 1903 at this place belong to late Sri M.R.Ry.M.Doorvasa Mudaliar who was the beloved and ardent disciple of HIS HOLINESS. He was managing the Shrine and doing daily Puja till he reached Heavenly Abode on Monday 17th Oct 1920 and since then his lineal descendent family members have been managing the Shrine and doing daily puja.<br>

On the right side of HIS HOLINESS Samadhi, the form of Lord Ganesh by the name "BALA VINAYAGAR" is there and to the left side of HIS HOLINESS Samadhi, the form of Lord Ganesh by the name "KAMALA VINAYAGAR" is there and this form has been growing in size with the passage of time.<br>
